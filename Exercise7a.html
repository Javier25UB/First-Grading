<p><img src="Images/Blade of the Immortal2.jpg" alt="Blade" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;margin-left:15px;float:left">
Manji is a samurai on the run after following his superior's order to kill a corrupt lord and his followers. Manji chose to care for his now insane sister Machi. While on the run, Machi is found being held hostage by a large group of rōnin out for a bounty on Manji's head. When Manji does comply with the rōnin's demands, the rōnin proceeds to kill Machi. In retaliation Manji kills every member of the group, but is mortally wounded. As there was nothing left to live for, he accepts his death, but Yaobikuni implants "sacred bloodworms" into his body, which heal him.
Fifty-two years later, now an ageless immortal, Manji is approached by a young girl named Rin Asano who requests his aid as a bodyguard to help avenge the death of her father, Kurose, at the hands of Kagehisa Anotsu and the Ittō-ryū, a society of samurai assassins whom he leads. While Manji reluctantly agrees when a Ittō-ryū member Sabato Kuroi who had the severed head of Rin's mother mounted on his left shoulder. Word of Sabato's death reaches Kagehisa after setting up the Ittō-ryū's contract with Kagimura Habaki for a place in the shogunate, sending Taito Magatsu to deal with Rin and her bodyguard. Magatsu is defeated, but is spared as he reveals Manji's immortality to the other Ittō-ryū members. Manji later encounters the Ittō-ryū member Eiku Shizuma, but is defeated.
Manji and Rin later arrive in Fukagawa where they encounter Kagehisa's loyal follower Makie Otono-Tachibana. While Makie had the upper hand, she cannot not bring herself to kill Manji. She reveals that she has been wondering if she is fighting for the right cause and that she has thought of leaving the group. Rin intervenes, telling her that she seeks revenge because of the death of his parents whom she loved and Makie leaves them quietly. The duo later encounter the Mugai-ryū, learning that Kagehisa is going to Mt. Takeo to recruit a dojo master. Mugai-ryū's member Shira attacks Rin after she intervened in his attempt to rape a prostitute that the Ittō-ryū hired to pose as Kagehisa. Just as he is about to kill her, Manji takes a hand, but lets him run away. Following Rin's encounter with the real Kagehisa, learning that Kagehisa's actions were influenced by the history between their grandfathers Takayoshi Asano and Saburō Anotsu, Rin leaves Manji to continue her hunt alone while he tries to find her.
When Kagehisa arrives at Mt. Takao he is betrayed by Habaki who has set up an ambush. Separately, Manji and Makie arrive soon after, resulting in an epic all-out battle as Makie sacrifices herself against gunfire from samurai in order to protect Kagehisa. Meanwhile, after killing hundreds on another part of the same battlefield while Kegehisa is being betrayed, Manji runs off after Shira as he abducts Rin to revenge Manji's previously chopping off his hand. Shira demands that Manji disarm himself, but Manji is mindful of Shira's duplicity he uses a small concealed dart to cut through the rope with which Rin is tied. They engage in a fist fight and Manji sends Shira spiraling to his death off a cliff. Although weakened and bloodied, Kagehisa kills Habaki, and then he encounters Manji who in the end defeats him. Rin is offered to deliver the killing blow of vengeance, while Kagehisa warns Manji that his sons will come after him. Despite his wounds, Manji survives to the battle.</p>

<a name="Maze"><h3>The Maze Runner</h3>
<br>
<p><img src="Images/The Maze Runner2.jpg" alt="Run" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;margin-left:15px;float:left">
A teenager wakes up inside an underground elevator with no memory of his identity. Some male youths greet him in a large grassy area, called the "Glade," enclosed by tall stone walls. The boys, the "Gladers," have formed a rudimentary society, and each assumes specialized tasks. Their leader, Alby, says that every boy eventually recalls his name but not his past. The boy learns that a vast Maze surrounding them is the only way out. During the day, designated Runners search the Maze for an escape route and return before nightfall when the entrance closes. No one has ever survived a night in the Maze. In a competition with another boy named Gally, the boy suddenly remembers his name: Thomas. The next day, he is attacked by Ben, a Runner who has been stung and left delirious by a Griever, one of the deadly techno-organic creatures that roam the Maze at night. Ben is forced into the Maze and left to die, as there is no cure for his condition. Alby and Minho, the lead Runner, later retrace Ben's steps inside the Maze. Minho reappears at dusk and is dragging Alby, who is stung, but they are unable to reach the closing entrance in time. Thomas runs into the Maze to help, which leaves all three trapped. Thomas lures a Griever into a closing passageway, which causes it to be crushed. The three manage to survive the night and return the next morning.

The first-ever girl arrives in the elevator, with a note saying that she is the last one to enter the Glade. She recognizes Thomas, but he cannot remember her. Thomas, Minho, Frypan, Winston, and Zart enter the Maze; locate the Griever corpse; and remove a beeping mechanical device from inside it. Gally claims that Thomas has jeopardized the fragile peace between the youths and the Grievers, and wants him punished. However, Newt, the group's second-in-command, instead designates Thomas as a Runner. Minho shows Thomas a hand-constructed model of the Maze that is based on previous explorations. The Maze's numbered sections open and close in a regular sequence. Thomas realizes that the device corresponds to a section of the Maze.

The girl, Teresa, has two syringes filled with an unknown substance. One is used on Alby, and he recovers from the Griever sting. Minho and Thomas venture back into the Maze with the device and discover a possible exit. A laser then scans the two, and the exit closes. Thomas and Minho start to run away, as traps activated by lasers nearly kill them. That night, the Maze entrance does not close, and others open, which let Grievers pour in. A massacre ensues, as the Gladers struggle to fight back or hide. Alby, Zart, Clint, and several others are killed. Afterwards, Gally punches Thomas and blames him for everything that happened. Thomas, who has been having disconnected memory flashes since his arrival, stabs himself with a severed Griever stinger in an attempt to revive his memory. The others inject him with the last anti-venom. Unconscious, he recalls that he and Teresa worked for the organization that created the Maze, WCKD. The boys unknowingly have been test subjects for an experiment. Thomas awakens and shares that information with Newt, Minho, Chuck, and Teresa. Thomas then reveals himself and Teresa and confesses that they worked with WCKD and studied the boys for years.

Meanwhile, Gally has taken command and intends to sacrifice Thomas and Teresa to the Grievers to restore peace. However, several Gladers form a group, free them, and approach the Maze in an attempt to find an escape. Gally and a few others refuse to leave. Fighting Grievers as they go, Jeff and several other Gladers are killed. The Gladers eventually enter a laboratory strewn with corpses. In a video recording, a woman, Ava Paige, explains that the planet has been devastated by a massive solar flare, followed by a pandemic of a deadly virus, the Flare. The teens learn that they were part of an experiment intended to develop a cure. Paige is seen shooting herself in the video as the lab is overtaken by armed men. Gally suddenly arrives with a gun. Having been stung by a Griever, he insists that they must stay in the Maze and aims at Thomas. Minho impales Gally with a spear, but Gally has already fired the gun, with Chuck fatally shot. While Thomas mourns over Chuck, masked armed men then rush in and take the rest of the group to a helicopter. It flies over a vast desert wasteland and approaches a ruined city.

Later, the supposedly dead scientists meet in a room. Paige notes that the experiment has been successful: the survivors are now entering Phase Two.</p>

<a name="Robot"><h3>Pacific Rim</h3>
<br>
<p><img src="Images/Pacific Rim2.jpg" alt="Run" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;margin-left:15px;float:left">
In 2013, an interdimensional portal called "the Breach" opens at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, from which giant monsters, the Kaiju, emerge, destroying various cities around the Pacific Rim. In response, humanity builds massive robots called Jaegers to combat the monsters. Each Jaeger is piloted by two to three pilots, who are mentally linked in a process called "drifting" to share the mental stress of piloting the machine.

In 2020, brothers Yancy and Raleigh Becket pilot the Jaeger Gipsy Danger to defend Anchorage from a Category-3 Kaiju codenamed "Knifehead". During the confrontation, the Kaiju unexpectedly pierces the Jaeger's armor, ripping out its left arm and half of its head, which pulls Yancy out of the Conn Pod, killing him. Raleigh, piloting the damaged Jaeger solo, kills Knifehead and walks Gipsy back to shore by himself before collapsing. Traumatized by the loss of his brother and the strain of drifting alone, Raleigh quits the Jaeger program.

Five years later, in response to the increasing power and number of Kaiju attacks and despite the protest of the Jaeger program director Marshal Stacker Pentecost, world leaders decide to cease funding for the Jaeger program and replace it with coastal defense walls, believing it to be a more effective option. However, during a subsequent attack on Sydney, a Kaiju demolishes the city's coastal defense wall and proceeds to wreak havoc and destruction, before being stopped by the Jaeger Striker Eureka. Defying their decision, Marshal Pentecost moves the remaining four Jaegers to the Shatterdome: the last remaining Jaeger base in Hong Kong to continue fighting the Kaiju. Determined to bring about the destruction of the Kaiju once and for all, Pentecost plans to destroy the Breach with a nuclear bomb.

Meanwhile, Raleigh is engaged in the coastal wall-building program. Pentecost tracks him down and persuades Raleigh to come back to the Jaeger program. At the Hong Kong Shatterdome, Raleigh meets Mako Mori, Pentecost's adopted daughter and director of the Jaeger restoration program. Raleigh and Mako are found to be compatible pilots; Pentecost is against Mako entering the Jaeger program, but Mako convinces him to permit her to copilot the restored Gipsy Danger. During their first drift test, Mako gets lost deep in the memory of her parents dying in a Kaiju attack, known as "chasing the rabbit". Believing that she is going to destroy the Kaiju, Mako activates Gipsy's plasma cannon, which threatens to destroy the Shatterdome, but Gipsy gets shut down before that can happen. Because of this, both are subsequently relieved of combat duty. While in the drift, Raleigh saw within Mako's memories that it was Pentecost who saved her from the Kaiju attack that killed her parents, which explains why he won't let Mako pilot a Jaeger. Armed with this knowledge, Raleigh confronts Pentecost and tries to persuade him to bring Mako back on board.

Pentecost consults the Kaiju experts, Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb, to plan the assault on the Breach. Newton was able to drift with a piece of a Kaiju brain, but only saw fragmented memories. It is revealed that Kaiju are in fact genetically-engineered by a race of extraterrestrial beings who are using them to conquer Earth. He proposes finding a "fresh" brain, and under Pentecost's advice, Newton meets Hannibal Chau, a black market dealer of Kaiju organs. When Newton tells him that he drifted with a Kaiju, Chau explains that due to the two-way nature of drifting, the brain Newton had drifted with accessed his memory as well. Since all the Kaiju share collective memories, they now have some of his knowledge.

Two Category-4 Kaiju, Otachi and Leatherback, emerge and approach Hong Kong to find Newton. The humans deploy three Jaegers, Crimson Typhoon, Cherno Alpha, and Striker Eureka to intercept them. The creatures destroy Cherno Alpha and Crimson Typhoon, and disable Striker Eureka with an EMP blast. Otachi proceeds to rampage through the city in an attempt to find Newton, leaving Leatherback to attack the immobilized Jaeger's Conn-Pod, which leaves Herc injured. Having no other choice, Pentecost deploys Gipsy Danger due to its analog systems being powered by a nuclear reactor making it immune from EMP attack. Gipsy Danger saves Striker in time before the kaiju can smash it, and manages to kill both Kaiju, using its plasma cannon to take down Leatherback and a built-in sword to slice Otachi in half. Inspecting the corpses, Newton and Chau find out that Otachi is pregnant. The infant Kaiju bursts out, swallows Chau whole, and dies strangled by its own umbilical cord. Newton and Hermann drift together with the infant's brain, discover the Breach will only open in the presence of a Kaiju's DNA.

Shatterdome proceeds with the attack on the Breach with Gipsy Danger and Striker Eureka. Pentecost, who is dying from radiation sickness, replaces the injured Herc Hansen to pilot Striker Eureka with Herc's son Chuck. Two Category-4, Scunner and Raiju, with one Category-5, Slattern, emerge from the Breach to defend it. Gipsy Danger kills Raiju, but Striker Eureka is immobilized by Slattern. Gipsy Danger attempts to help Striker Eureka, but Pentecost warns the crippled Jaeger to stay away, telling them to use Gipsy Danger's nuclear reactor to destroy the Breach. Pentecost and Chuck sacrifice themselves as they detonate the bomb, killing Scunner and mortally wounding Slattern.

Gipsy Danger finishes off Slattern with a blast from its nuclear vortex then uses its corpse to go through the Breach, where Raleigh sets Gipsy's reactor to detonate, before ejecting from Gipsy and being thrown back through the Breach. The reactor detonates, closing the Breach. The two escape pods surface in the Pacific Ocean, while Raleigh and Mako embrace as helicopters are sent out to retrieve them.

At the start of the credits, Chau cuts his way out of the infant Kaiju carcass and asks where his shoe is.</p>

In Ixtenco, Mexico, Nick Fury and Maria Hill investigate an unnatural storm and encounter the Earth Elemental. Quentin Beck, a super-powered individual, arrives to defeat the creature. Beck subsequently defeats the Elemental and is recruited by Fury and Hill. Meanwhile, in New York City, the Midtown School of Science and Technology completes its year, which was restarted to accommodate the students who previously disintegrated five years ago as a result of Thanos' actions.[N 1] They had reappeared un-aged, thanks to the actions of the Avengers.[N 2] The school organizes a two-week summer field trip to Europe, where Peter Parker—who is still mourning the death of his mentor and father figure Tony Stark—plans to reveal to classmate MJ his attraction to her. Happy Hogan informs Parker that Fury intends to contact him, but Parker ignores Fury's phone call.

Parker and his classmates travel to Venice, Italy, where the Water Elemental attacks. Parker helps protect his classmates, while Beck arrives and destroys the creature. Fury meets with Parker and gives him Stark's glasses, which were meant for his successor. The glasses enable him to communicate with and take command of the artificial intelligence E.D.I.T.H., which has access to Stark Industries' databases and commands a large orbital weapons supply. Beck claims to hail from an alternate reality within the Multiverse, where the four Elementals killed his family and destroyed his civilization. He predicts that the Fire Elemental will appear in Prague. Parker declines Fury's invitation to join the fight and returns to his class trip.

Fury secretly changes the class's itinerary to divert the students to Prague. There, Parker is forced to help Beck fight the Fire Elemental to again protect his friends. Beck manages to destroy the creature with Parker's help. Fury and Hill invite Parker and Beck to Berlin to discuss the formation of a new superhero team, but Parker decides that Beck should go alone and transfers control of E.D.I.T.H. to him. In actuality, Beck is secretly a former Stark Industries holographic-illusions specialist who was fired for his unstable nature, and now leads a team of disgruntled ex-Stark employees, using advanced projector drones to simulate the Elemental attacks, masquerade as a hero, and gain control of E.D.I.T.H. so they use the orbital weaponized drones to increase the scale of their illusions.

After MJ tells Parker she knows he is Spider-Man, they discover that a piece of debris she retrieved during the battle is a projector that shows part of the Air Elemental's attack, leading them to realize Beck's deception. Parker travels to Berlin to warn Fury, only to be tricked by Beck with an illusory Fury into revealing the names of his friends who know about Beck's plan. Left for dead by Beck, Parker contacts Hogan, who flies him to London, where his classmates are. Beck uses E.D.I.T.H. to orchestrate a fusion of all the Elementals, as a cover to kill Parker's friends. Parker is able to disrupt the illusions, so Beck attacks him with drones. Parker defeats Beck and regains control of E.D.I.T.H. Beck is killed by misfired gunshots from the drones, but one of his associates escapes with data from the drones. After returning to New York City, Parker begins a relationship with MJ.

In a mid-credits scene, J. Jonah Jameson of TheDailyBugle.net broadcasts doctored footage of the London incident in which Beck frames Spider-Man for the drone attack and his death, exposing Spider-Man's secret identity to the world, much to Parker's shock. In a post-credits scene, Fury and Hill are revealed to be the Skrulls Talos and Soren in disguise, under orders from the real Fury while he is away commanding a Skrull spaceship.</p>

<br>
<p><img src="Images/The Avengers2.jpg" alt="Run" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;margin-left:15px;float:left">
The Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract,[N 2] a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and his lieutenant Agent Maria Hill arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent Phil Coulson says that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him in his getaway.

In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the "Avengers Initiative". Agent Natasha Romanoff heads to Kolkata to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Coulson visits Tony Stark to have him check Selvig's research, and Fury approaches Steve Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract.

In Stuttgart, Barton steals iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki gets escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor, his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier. Upon arrival, Loki gets imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.

The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them is not enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to confirm himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, and a wormhole generator Selvig built, to open a wormhole above Stark Tower to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.

Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk beats Loki into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Midtown Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit loses power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if needed.</p>
