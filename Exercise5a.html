  <dt>Computer</dt>
  <dd>- A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.</dd>
  <dt>Cyber Security</dt>
  <dd>- Cyber security refers to the body of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. Cyber security may also be referred to as information technology security.</dd>
  <dt>Internet</dt>
  <dd>- a global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols.</dd>
  <dt>Programming</dt>
  <dd>- Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++.</dd>
  <dt>Programming Languages</dt>
  <dd>- A programming language is a set of commands, instructions, and other syntax use to create a software program. Languages that programmers use to write code are called "high-level languages." This code can be compiled into a "low-level language," which is recognized directly by the computer hardware</dd>
  <dt>Algorithms</dt>
  <dd>- An algorithm is a set of instructions designed to perform a specific task. This can be a simple process, such as multiplying two numbers, or a complex operation, such as playing a compressed video file. In computer programming, algorithms are often created as functions.</dd>
  <dt>Computer Software</dt>
  <dd>- Software, instructions that tell a computer what to do. Software comprises the entire set of programs, procedures, and routines associated with the operation of a computer system. A set of instructions that directs a computer's hardware to perform a task is called a program, or software program.</dd>
  <dt>Internet Privacy</dt>
  <dd>- The definition of online privacy is the level of privacy protection an individual has while connected to the Internet. It covers the amount of online security available for personal and financial data, communications, and preferences.</dd>
  <dt>Internet Piracy</dt>
  <dd>- Online piracy is the practice of downloading and distributing copyrighted content digitally without permission, such as music or software. The principle behind piracy has predated the creation of the Internet, but its online popularity arose alongside the internet.</dd>
  <dt>Software Developer</dt>
  <dd>- Software developers typically do the following: Analyze users' needs and then design, test, and develop software to meet those needs. Recommend software upgrades for customers' existing programs and systems. Design each piece of an application or system and plan how the pieces will work together.</dd>
